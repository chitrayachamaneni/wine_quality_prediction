MACHINE LEARNING MODEL TO PREDICT THE QUALITY OF WINE USING LINEAR REGRESSION:

This repository comprises the source code and accompanying resources for predicting wine quality utilizing the Linear Regression machine learning algorithm. Our aim is to forecast the quality of wine based on various wine features.

LINEAR REGRESSION:
Linear regression stands as a supervised machine learning algorithm, which calculates the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features. The algorithm's objective is to determine the optimal linear equation that can forecast the dependent variable's value based on the independent variables.

ADVANTAGES OF LINEAR REGRESSION:
1. Simplicity of Implementation: Linear Regression offers a straightforward implementation process, delivering satisfactory results with ease. It boasts a notably lower time complexity compared to several other machine learning algorithms. Additionally, its mathematical equations are comprehensible and interpretable, making it accessible to both novices and seasoned analysts.
2. Effortlessness and Interpretability: Linear Regression's key strength lies in its simplicity. The method is easy to grasp and execute, catering to beginners and experienced practitioners alike. It yields a simple equation that delineates the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
